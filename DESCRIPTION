Description: In repeated measures studies with extreme large or small values it is common 
  that the subjects measurements on average are closer to the mean of the basic population. 
  Interpreting possible changes in the mean in such situations can lead to biased results 
  since the values were not randomly selected, they come from truncated sampling.
  This method allows to estimate the range of means where treatment effects are likely to occur 
  when regression toward the mean is present.
